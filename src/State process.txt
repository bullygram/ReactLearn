1. we need the components to inter communicate, we create a text box and cardlist.
2. all of the intercommunication should happen using the parent.
3. Now we need a memory to hold the state of the app. And we call it state,
4. Now we need to create a state in parent so that we can passit as properties to component.
5. In the parent class we create a constructor and create and initialize a state object.
6. State are mutable and props are not changable.

7.Now we can feed the data from the state to the prop in the parent, using "this.state-dec.value.
previousely we directly fed the data directly without state

8. Now in part one we saw how using state we feed data into props. and in part two we focus on sending data into state.
9. as follows, we create a method to record events/changes on the textbox. and pass it as prop to search box component 
here in the method onsetchange method, we update the state field variable. and make changes to the cardlist.
