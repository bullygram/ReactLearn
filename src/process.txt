We are working on error boundries. ans it is a new concept in react v16.

previously when a error happense in component level,  it resulted in app to be crashed,

And error boundries help in avoiding it and hepls in showing "Something went wrong" text and so on.


1. we create a ErrorBoundries component.

2. Here in constructor, we allow the props to be flowin through, by assigning props as parameter in constructor and super.

3. ane we create a  componentDidCatch(error, info){} block to catch error. and in case yes, we setState({hasError:true})

3. And then we create a render function that either returns the error text, based on the setState, or the app flow itself coming through ErrorBoundries as props.
it is much like enclosing app inside of ErrorBoundries tag.
